## General info
The aim of this project is to analyze the importance of characters in the Harry Potter book series, and to extract network and community analysis from their appearances throughout the books. By analyzing the characters' roles and relationships within the narrative, we can gain insights into the underlying themes and messages of the books, as well as the impact that each character has on the story as a whole. Through network analysis, we can identify the key players in the story and the ways in which they interact with one another, while community analysis allows us to group characters based on their similarities and differences.
